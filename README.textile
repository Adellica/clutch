Clutch is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/. Although it's in a very early stage of development, Clutch supports most of the basic Apache CouchDB API. To get a sense of where Clutch is at, please view the included tests.

h2. Clutch (Clojure) View Server

In order to use Clojure for views, you must add the following to the 'local.ini' file of your Apache CouchDB installation (replacing &lt;path ...&gt; with the appropiate paths).

<pre>
  [query_servers]
  clojure = java -cp <path to clojure.jar>/clojure.jar:<path to clojure-contrib.jar>/clojure-contrib.jar clojure.main <path to clutch project folder>/clutch/src/com/ashafa/clutch/view_server.clj
</pre>
