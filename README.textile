Clutch is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/. Although it's in a very early stage of development (Clutch API subject to change), Clutch supports most of the basic Apache CouchDB APIs. To get a sense of where Clutch is at, please view the included tests. 

h2. Clutch (Clojure) View Server

In order to use Clojure for views, you must first compile the view server.

From your repl...

<pre>
 ;; Following line is optional and may already be set (defaults to "classes" if not) 
 ;; (set! *compile-path* "<path to where you want your classes generated>")

 (compile 'com.ashafa.clutch.view-server)
</pre>

... then add the following to the 'local.ini' file of your Apache CouchDB installation (replacing &lt;path to...&gt; with the appropiate paths).

<pre>
  [query_servers]
  clojure = java -cp <path to clojure.jar>/clojure.jar:<path to clojure-contrib.jar or clojure-contrib source>/clojure-contrib(.jar|/src):<*compile-path* (see above)> com.ashafa.clutch.view_server
</pre>
