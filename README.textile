Clutch is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/. Although it's in an early stage of development (Clutch API subject to change), Clutch supports most of the basic Apache CouchDB APIs. To get a sense of where we are at with Clutch, please view "the tests":http://github.com/tashafa/clutch/blob/1.1-compatible/src/test/clojure/test_clutch.clj . 

h3. Download and Installation

Clutch uses Leiningen. For installation and help on using Leiningen visit the "github repo":http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/ .

To include Clutch in your project, in your project.clj add the following to your ":dependencies":

<pre>[com.ashafa/clutch "0.2.1"]</pre>

... then from your command line, execute:

<pre>lein deps</pre>

This will create a compiled Clutch jar in the "/lib" (or path indicated by your leiningen project.clj file) of your project.

h4. Working with the source 

If you are working with a clone of Clutch from github for development, contribution, or testing purposes, in your command line in the project directory, execute:

<pre>lein install</pre>

This will leave a fully-compiled Clutch jar file in the project directory. You can also run the Clutch tests by executing the following in your command line:

<pre>lein test test-clutch</pre>
 
h3. Configuring your CouchDB installation to use the Clutch view server

To use clojure for views and filters, add the following to the 'local.ini' file of your CouchDB installation (replacing &lt;path to...&gt; with the appropiate paths).

<pre>
  [query_servers]
  clojure = java -cp <path to clojure.jar>/clojure.jar:<path to clojure-contrib.jar or clojure-contrib source>/clojure-contrib(.jar|/src):<clutch jar file OR *compile-path* (see above)> com.ashafa.clutch.view_server
</pre>
