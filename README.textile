Clutch is a "Clojure":http://clojure.org library for "Apache CouchDB":http://couchdb.apache.org/. Although it's in a very early stage of development (Clutch API subject to change), Clutch supports most of the basic Apache CouchDB APIs. To get a sense of where Clutch is at, please view the included tests.
